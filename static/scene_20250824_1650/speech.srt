1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,738
The drums of war were booming from the

2
00:00:02,738 --> 00:00:05,477
deck of the Revenge, and the deathly beat

3
00:00:05,477 --> 00:00:08,215
was like thunder in Tanâ€™s chest. The ship

4
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:10,954
was now so close that she could see

5
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:13,693
the wild eyes of the pirates crowded together

6
00:00:13,693 --> 00:00:16,431
along the guardrail, swinging grappling hooks and clashing

7
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:19,170
their weapons together like the instruments of a

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,909
terrible metallic orchestra, howling and jeering as if

9
00:00:21,909 --> 00:00:24,647
possessed by the devil.
