1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,866
The Road goes ever on and on, Down

2
00:00:02,866 --> 00:00:05,732
from the door where it began. Now far

3
00:00:05,732 --> 00:00:08,598
ahead the Road has gone, And I must

4
00:00:08,598 --> 00:00:11,465
follow, if I can, Pursuing it with eager

5
00:00:11,465 --> 00:00:14,331
feet, Until it joins some larger way, Where

6
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:17,197
many paths and errands meet. And whither then?

7
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:20,064
I cannot say.
