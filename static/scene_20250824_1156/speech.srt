00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,577
The wise woman of the northern tower spoke

2
00:00:02,577 --> 00:00:05,153
thus to the young king: "Power is not

3
00:00:05,153 --> 00:00:07,730
in the strength of your sword-arm, nor in

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,307
the height of your throne. True sovereignty lies

5
00:00:10,307 --> 00:00:12,884
in knowing when to speak and when to

6
00:00:12,884 --> 00:00:15,461
listen, when to act and when to wait,

7
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:18,039
for the land itself will teach you its

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,615
needs if you have ears to hear."
