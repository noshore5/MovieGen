"At the edge of the village, the river Styx looks like any other stream. Until midnight, when coins float against the current, and voices beg you not to pick them up. Last nightâ€¦ you did."

## Scene Context Inference
The scene implies a solitary protagonist, addressed directly, who has recently committed a perilous act. The "you" suggests either a first-person narrative or a direct address from an unseen narrator to the central character. The setting is a rural or ancient village's outskirts, where a seemingly ordinary stream transforms into the mythical River Styx at midnight. The time period is ambiguous but leans towards an ancient or dark fantasy era, given the mythological reference and lack of modern technology.

Environmental details are crucial: a quiet, sleeping village provides a stark contrast to the river's supernatural awakening. At midnight, the river, normally appearing mundane, reveals its true, eerie nature. Moonlight would be the primary illumination, casting long, deep shadows, amplifying the sense of isolation and foreboding. The air would be cold, perhaps with a subtle mist or an unnerving silence that allows disembodied, pleading voices to be heard clearly.

The mood is one of profound dread, supernatural suspense, and impending consequence. There's a strong undercurrent of dark fantasy and perhaps a touch of horror. The act of picking up the coins signifies a transgression, hinting at a pact or a curse now unleashed. The tone is somber, mysterious, and highly atmospheric, focused on the protagonist's dawning realization or regret.

Important elements include the river itself, acting as a gateway; ancient, spectral coins floating unnaturally; and the unseen voices of the dead or guardians, warning against interference. The protagonist's hand, reaching into the water, is a pivotal object, representing the moment of choice and its immediate aftermath.

## Visual Beats

**PROMPT_1:**
A serene, wide shot of a river at the edge of a rustic, sleeping village at dusk. The water reflects the last slivers of orange from a setting sun, appearing completely ordinary. Distant, warm lights twinkle from a few village homes. The scene is calm, deceptively peaceful, with ancient, gnarled trees lining the riverbanks. Cinematic lighting, golden hour glow, highly detailed, tranquil yet hinting at unseen depths.

**PROMPT_2:**
The River Styx at the stroke of midnight. The water, now dark and inky black, is illuminated by an ethereal, greenish-blue moonlight filtering through a dense canopy. Ancient, tarnished coins, some appearing to be gold, others bronze, float mysteriously *against* the sluggish current, defying gravity. A subtle, cold mist hovers just above the water's surface. Dark fantasy, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, volumetric fog, ultra-realistic.

**PROMPT_3:**
A close-up shot, submerged perspective, looking up through the dark, murky water of the River Styx. An ancient, spectral coin, glowing faintly with an internal, unearthly light, slowly drifts upwards against the current. Bubbles of unseen origin rise around it. The water appears thick, almost viscous, with vague, spectral distortions in the background. Cinematic underwater lighting, volumetric god rays, high detail, eerie, supernatural.

**PROMPT_4:**
A lone, weathered hand, perhaps belonging to a male protagonist, reaches into the chilling, midnight waters of the River Styx. The fingers are extended, poised to grasp one of the unnaturally floating coins. The faint glow from the coins reflects on the skin, and a chilling, almost audible, wave of spectral energy emanates from the water. Deep shadows, dramatic rim lighting on the hand, focus on texture and detail, dark fantasy, suspenseful.

**PROMPT_5:**
A low-angle shot, looking up at the protagonist's face, their features illuminated by the sickly, green-blue glow reflecting from the newly acquired spectral coin held in their palm. Their eyes are wide with a mix of fear, regret, and dawning horror. A faint, almost transparent whisper of spectral figures or mist seems to curl around their head. Dark, cold village background, cinematic lighting, deep shadows, ultra-detailed facial expression, profound dread.

**PROMPT_6:**
A wide, desolate shot of the River Styx winding through a moonlit, barren landscape just outside the dark, silent village. The river glows with a faint, unnatural luminescence, and almost imperceptible, ghostly ripples emanate from its surface. The air is heavy with an oppressive, unseen presence, hinting at the multitude of spectral voices. Overcast moon, cold color palette, dark fantasy, desolate, atmospheric.
