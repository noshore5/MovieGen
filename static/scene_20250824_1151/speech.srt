00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost; The

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,000
old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,500
From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the shadows shall spring;

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,000
Renewed shall be blade that was broken, The crownless again shall be king.
