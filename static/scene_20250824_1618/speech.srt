1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,933
Through the ragged hole in the dungeon wall,

2
00:00:02,933 --> 00:00:05,866
Tan watched a cloud slowly swallow the moon.

3
00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:08,799
Another cannon boomed and was answered by the

4
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:11,732
rattle of musket fire. She waited for more,

5
00:00:11,732 --> 00:00:14,665
but an eerie silence fell instead, punctured softly

6
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:17,598
by whispers from the beach below. The shadows

7
00:00:17,598 --> 00:00:20,532
darkened and lengthened around her and Kier, who

8
00:00:20,532 --> 00:00:23,465
was leaning against the dungeon wall awaiting her

9
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:26,398
answer. His eyes hadn’t strayed from her since

10
00:00:26,398 --> 00:00:29,331
he’d made his proposition, his gaze full of

11
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:32,264
promise or deceit, or perhaps both. She still

12
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:35,197
couldn’t tell. 'I can offer you a life

13
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:38,130
of freedom.' And all he wanted in return

14
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,064
was her soul.
