All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost; The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost. From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the shadows shall spring; Renewed shall be blade that was broken, The crownless again shall be king.
The Road goes ever on and on, Down from the door where it began. Now far ahead the Road has gone, And I must follow, if I can, Pursuing it with eager feet, Until it joins some larger way, Where many paths and errands meet. And whither then? I cannot say.
I wish it need not have happened in my time," said Frodo. "So do I," said Gandalf, "and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us. And already, Frodo, our time is beginning to look black. The Enemy is fast becoming very strong. His plans are far from ripe, I think, but they are ripening. We shall be hard put to it. We should be very hard put to it, even if it were not for this dreadful chance.
There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach.
And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City.
Out of doubt, out of dark to the day’s rising I came singing in the sun, sword unsheathing. To hope’s end I rode and to heart’s breaking: Now for wrath, now for ruin and a red nightfall!
The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.
The stars are veiled. Something stirs in the East. A sleepless malice. The eye of the enemy is moving. He is here.
The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all turns to silver glass, and then you see it: white shores, and beyond, a far green country under a swift sunrise.
The Shadow that bred them can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own. I don't think it gave life to the Orcs, it only ruined them and twisted them.
In the depths of the ancient forest, where the great trees whispered secrets older than the kingdoms of men, there dwelt a silence that spoke of forgotten magic. The golden leaves fell like memories, each one carrying the echo of songs sung in the Elder Days, when the world was young and full of wonder.
Beneath the starlit mountain peaks, where eagles soared on wings of silver wind, the ancient paths wound through valleys deep and wild. Here walked the guardians of old lore, bearing staffs of weathered oak and cloaks woven from twilight mist, seeking the hidden gates that led between the worlds.
The dragon's hoard lay scattered in the moonlight, each gem a captured star, each golden cup a memory of feast-halls long abandoned. Yet among all these treasures, the greatest prize was not of metal or stone, but the courage found in small folk who dared to walk where mighty warriors feared to tread.
When the horns of the woodland realm sounded across the darkening vale, the very stones seemed to remember their purpose. Ancient runes blazed with inner fire, and the voices of the earth itself rose in harmony with the elven-song, calling forth the guardians who had slept beneath root and stone.
The wise woman of the northern tower spoke thus to the young king: "Power is not in the strength of your sword-arm, nor in the height of your throne. True sovereignty lies in knowing when to speak and when to listen, when to act and when to wait, for the land itself will teach you its needs if you have ears to hear."
From the Grey Havens to the Lonely Mountain, from the Shire's green hills to the forests of the north, there runs a thread of silver light that binds all living things. Those who learn to see this thread may walk the secret roads that lead beyond the circles of the world, where time flows like honey and every step is a choice between what was and what might yet be.
In the shadow of the iron crown, where the dark lord's power pressed down like a weight of years, there grew a single flower. White as starlight, fragile as hope, it bloomed in defiance of all darkness. And in its petals was written the promise that no shadow, however deep, could last forever while beauty remained in the world.
The mapmaker's daughter traced the ancient charts with fingers gentle as rain, reading the stories written in river-bend and mountain-rise. "Here," she whispered, "lies the path to the Sunless Sea, where the ships of memory sail forever between yesterday and tomorrow, carrying the dreams of all who have loved and lost."
When the last bell of the harbor city rang across the evening waters, the fisherman's son saw lights beneath the waves - not the cold gleam of drowned gold, but the warm glow of windows in halls where the sea-folk kept their eternal vigil, watching over all who trusted their lives to the mercy of the deep waters.
The scholar of the hidden library opened the book of days and read aloud the prophecy written in letters of flame: "When the silver tree blooms again in the court of the forgotten king, and the song of the first star echoes in halls of stone, then shall the lost path be revealed to those who seek with pure heart the healing of the world."
